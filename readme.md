## Broad rules

Some TLDs are blocked. Someone is using randomly-generated domains on these TLDs to spam malware sites. See [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32201420) HN thread.

Blocked TLDs:
- .it
- .pl
- .de

## Todo

- [ ] Script to combine subscribed list into `rules.txt` to reduce hassle when setting up a new browser

## Subscribed lists

In addition to my own set of rules, I am subscribed to the following lists:

## Criteria and disclaimer

This blacklist is solely composed of sites I consider to be SEO spammers; i.e. sites that deliberately game rankings on search engines and provide low-quality, useless, or irrelevant results.

**The presence of a site on this list is not representative of my personal views or beliefs**, beyond my view that the blocked site provides low-quality content.
