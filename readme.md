## Criteria and disclaimer

This blacklist is solely composed of sites I consider to be SEO spammers; i.e. sites that deliberately game rankings on search engines and provide low-quality or useless results.

**The presence of a site on this list is not representative of my personal views or beliefs**, beyond my view that the blocked site provides low-quality content.

## Subscribed lists
