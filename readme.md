# ublacklist-rules

My personal set of rules for the [uBlacklist](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist) search results filter.

**Pull requests welcome\***

\**only if you're cool and have some cool additions or advice.*

Since I don't use the extension's sync feature, I regularly move new rules from the extension to this txt file, which is one of my subscribed lists in the extension. That way, I can keep things in sync and have a backup of my rules.

Subscribe to this list:

## Todo

- [ ] Script to combine subscribed list into `rules.txt` to reduce hassle when setting up a new browser

## Subscribed lists

In addition to my own set of rules, I am subscribed to the following lists:

## Criteria and disclaimer

This blacklist is solely composed of sites I consider to be SEO spammers; i.e. sites that deliberately game rankings on search engines and provide low-quality, useless, or irrelevant results.

**The presence of a site on this list is not representative of my personal views or beliefs**, beyond my view that the blocked site provides low-quality content.
